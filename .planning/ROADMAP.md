Every first-party prompt in the application is wrapped in XML tags like
Programming Desk (`prompts/*.xml` + `_shared/core-directives.xml` there; the
same seat-prompt shape here), and a CI gate keeps it that way. Requirements
PROM-01..PROM-08 in `milestones/v17-REQUIREMENTS.md`.

<summary>v20 Wiring (Phases 97–103) — IN PROGRESS</summary>

Goal: establish verified wiring of the substrate, memory, solo/desk modes, Omp engine, real U2 LocalExecutor, schedulers/dead-module cleanup/environment documentation, and Ultrathink integration/cleanup. Phase 102 is planned from the uplift-derived G9–G11 gaps; it depends on Phase 101, whose completion is not established in this worktree.

### Phase 102: Schedulers, dead modules, and environment documentation

Goal: close uplift gaps G9–G11 by wiring existing watchdog and pin-bump schedules, removing unreachable/dead modules, documenting supported environment variables, and reporting wiring status without executing scheduled work. Phase 102 depends on Phase 101; its completion is not established in this worktree.

Requirements: G9-SCHED, G10-EXEC, G10-PLUGINS, G10-X, G10-REACH, G11-ENV, and G9-DOCTOR.

Acceptance criteria:
1. Tests show that the driver ticks watchdog and pin-bump schedules; due prompt work uses a fake delegate parent, or records an explicit blocked receipt when no executable delegate is available.
2. No tools module is unreachable except documented, explicitly flag-gated modules.
3. The committed environment-name/purpose table is AST-derived, and CI fails when a supported environment name is missing from the table.
4. Doctor reports disabled families and scheduled work whose runner was not observed without executing schedules; the exact requested gates are green, or each baseline failure is explicitly named.

Additional safety constraints: exec-job operations remain approval-gated; plugins require exact `OMEGA_PRIME_PLUGINS=1` opt-in and remain off otherwise; `x_tweepy` is removed while urllib X behavior is retained. Preserve approval gates for sends, posts, merges, deploys, and pin-bump mutation. Do not activate live providers or integrations.

- [ ] Phase 97: Substrate direct connect + settings loader + no time caps
- [ ] Phase 98: Shared memory via substrate, Hindsight fallback
- [ ] Phase 99: Solo mode, Desk optional
- [ ] Phase 100: omp engine wiring
- [ ] Phase 101: Real U2 LocalExecutor
- [ ] Phase 102: Schedulers, dead modules, env docs
- [ ] Phase 103: Ultrathink integration and cleanup

Phase 102 depends on Phase 101. Draft plans: [102-01](phases/102-schedulers-dead-modules-env-docs/102-01-PLAN.md), [102-02](phases/102-schedulers-dead-modules-env-docs/102-02-PLAN.md), [102-03](phases/102-schedulers-dead-modules-env-docs/102-03-PLAN.md), [102-04](phases/102-schedulers-dead-modules-env-docs/102-04-PLAN.md), [102-05](phases/102-schedulers-dead-modules-env-docs/102-05-PLAN.md).
